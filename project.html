        Health Disparities in India: A "Two Indias" Analysis

        <p>
            This project examines the "Two Indias" hypothesis, stating that India's healthcare system  constitutes two distinct entities with Southern states delivering higher-quality care at lower costs than their Northern counterparts <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620300186">(Das et al., 2016)</a>. This analysis investigates whether distinct geographic clustering exists in health outcomes and identifies explaining factors. It focuses on four case study states: Kerala and Tamilnadu (South) versus Gujarat and Haryana (North). These pairs have comparable GDP per capita and population sizes, yet demonstrate markedly different health outcomes. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is used as the primary outcome measure because it reflects overall health system quality, from prenatal care through early childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data was primarily sourced from the <a href="https://www.data.gov.in/">Open Government Data Portal of India</a>. Where unavailable, numbers were obtained from National Health Accounts reports and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). Given the manageable scale of state-level observations and prevalence of PDF source formats, manual aggregation in Excel proved more efficient than python coding. All code and data files are available in a public GitHub repository (linked to each graph), with original sources cited in each visualization. Note that bubble plots and trend charts use non-zero x-axes to emphasize meaningful variation where all states exceed baseline thresholds.

    <!-- CHART 1: CHOROPLETH MAP -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 45px; margin-top: 45px;">

            <p>
                The choropleth map displays state-wise IMR (2022). Indian administrative boundaries were obtained from a <a href=”https://github.com/AnujTiwari/India-State-and-Country-Shapefile-Updated-Jan-2020>publicly accessible repository</a> and converted to GeoJSON format via QGIS (open .shp file and export feature as GeoJSON), as access from Survey of India's official portal required lengthy approval processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The map reveals clear geographic patterns: low-IMR states concentrate in the South, while higher rates cluster in Central, Northern, and Eastern regions. Some Northeastern and Himalayan states also perform well, likely due to smaller populations, stronger social infrastructure, and targeted central government programs. India's federal structure grants states primary responsibility for health governance, with the central government providing policy frameworks and partial funding. This state-level autonomy makes cross-state comparisons particularly meaningful, making states the focus of this project rather than smaller union territories, which have different administrative structures and resource allocations.

                The second visualization challenges the assumption that wealth automatically yields better health. While overall correlation exists between GDP per capita and IMR, significant outliers emerge. Gujarat, with nearly identical GDP to Tamilnadu and exceeding Kerala's, records higher IMR. Haryana performs worse despite higher per capita income than both Southern states.

                Female literacy demonstrates strong correlation with IMR. Women's education influences maternal nutrition, birth spacing, and child-rearing practices, positively influencing child health. Kerala and Tamilnadu's high female literacy rates correspond with their low IMRs, while Gujarat and Haryana's lower rates associate with poorer outcomes. Notably, Gujarat performs better than Northern states with comparable literacy levels, suggesting additional factors at play.

                An interactive toggle visualization examines four inputs against IMR: Primary Health Centre (PHC) density; per capita government health expenditure; expenditure as percentage of state GDP; and medical college density per million (scraped from Wikipedia). 
            </p>
            <p>
                PHC density shows weak correlation where Tamilnadu and Kerala achieve superior outcomes with lower facility density than Gujarat, suggesting potential quality differences. Government expenditure reveals Tamilnadu and Kerala spend moderately more, though Haryana's spending nearly matches Tamilnadu's despite worse outcomes. Medical college density shows a strong correlation with Tamilnadu and Kerala having substantially higher concentrations of medical education than Gujarat and Haryana.

                To track spending efficiency over time, the trajectory plots track IMR against government spending (2014-2022). Gujarat demonstrates notable efficiency, reducing IMR from 35 to 26 despite lowest increase in per capita spending. However, this dramatic improvement likely reflects catch-up from a poor baseline combined with the 2018 Ayushman Bharat scheme (national level scheme providing health insurance to 500 million citizens) rather than solely state-level factors. Haryana showed similar initial decline but stagnated post-2019, possibly due to COVID-19 disruptions. Tamilnadu and Kerala's slower decline reflects their already-low 2014 baselines, indicating long-standing investment in health that predates this analysis period.

               An interactive toggle displays other health quality metrics across NFHS rounds 3, 4, and 5 (2005-2021), to compare the four states. Round 3 reveals substantial gaps in antenatal care and institutional deliveries between Northern and Southern states, though diarrhea prevalence shows less variation. Round 4 demonstrates convergence, particularly in institutional deliveries. Round 5 shows continued gap closure across all indicators, though Kerala and Tamilnadu maintain leads. Full immunization data appears only for Round 5.

                As a final test for the “Two Indias” theory, hierarchical clustering is employed using eight health system inputs and outputs. States are grouped into three clusters: High Performers, Low Performers, and Struggling States. The map provides compelling evidence for the "Two Indias" hypothesis: high-performing clusters concentrate in the South, while low-performing and struggling clusters dominate the North and East.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section style="margin-bottom: 45px; margin-top: 45px;">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Multiple factors explain North-South health disparities. Tamilnadu and Kerala represent regional party strongholds historically prioritizing welfare-oriented governance since independence. Conversely, Gujarat and recently, Haryana, have been Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strongholds, traditionally focused more on upper class and upper caste driven economic growth. Das et al.'s finding that Southern informal providers exceed Northern qualified doctors' competency underscores systemic quality differences transcending individual facilities or budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
            This analysis reveals that health outcomes depend less on resource quantity than strategic deployment and historical commitment to social development. While correlations identified here cannot establish causation (given limited data points and India's unique context) they surface critical questions about efficiency, quality, and equity in health systems that merit deeper investigation.
